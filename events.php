With activities held at every level—family, den, and pack—Cub Scouting provides a year-round program of fun and learning for boys and their families.

<h2>Eagle Scouts</h2>
<h6>51 years ago, 30 Lubbock Eagle Scouts made history</h6>
<p>If you think 30 boys getting the Eagle Scout Award at once is impressive today, just imagine that feat happening 51 years ago.
In 1960, the accomplishment was so amazing, in fact, that the President of the United States took notice. Click here to check out the telegram he sent.
On July 1, 1960, 30 boys from Lubbock, Tex., gathered for what was, at the time, the largest Eagle Scout Court of Honor in history.
